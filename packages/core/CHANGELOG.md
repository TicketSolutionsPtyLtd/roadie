# @oztix/roadie-core

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- f3990bd: Add `animate-pop-tap` — a 200ms tap response, where `animate-pop` at 600ms reads
  as a notification.

  Add the `navigator-expanded` variant, which Navigator's expanded vertical
  navigation is styled with, plus `@oztix/roadie-core/navigator`.

  `@oztix/roadie-core/navigator` also exports `getNavigatorExpandedScript`, an
  optional head script that lets a static site paint a persisted expanded vertical
  navigation before hydration, with the cookie name it reads and a serializer to
  write it.

  Add `is-translucent`, which lets content show through a raised or floating
  surface's fill under a backdrop blur. It pairs with `emphasis-raised`,
  `emphasis-floating` or `bg-raised`, keeps their rim light and shadow, and falls
  back to the solid fill without `backdrop-filter` support or under
  `prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce`. On an `is-interactive-field`, the
  field's hover, focus and invalid fills still win.

- 65ba926: Add `Drawer`, a surface that slides in from any edge and swipes away, built on
  Base UI's drawer primitive. Core gains the `motion-drawer` utility, which drives
  a drawer's edge transition and tracks Base UI's live swipe offset.
- 8c2ca73: One rule for the two motion prefixes: `animate-*` plays now, once, as a
  keyframe animation; `motion-*` is state-driven enter/exit only, a transition
  on Base UI's `data-starting-style` / `data-ending-style`.

  Renamed the keyframe mount animations to match:

  - `motion-fade-in` → `animate-fade-in`
  - `motion-scale-in` → `animate-scale-in`
  - `motion-pop-in` → `animate-pop-in`

  `motion-fade-out` and `motion-scale-out` are deprecated with no replacement —
  use `motion-scale` or `motion-slide` for the exit instead.

  All five old names remain as deprecated aliases until v3.

- 5363c7a: Add `Skeleton`, a placeholder that holds the space content will occupy while it
  loads. One component with a `shape` variant: `text` is a line at the inherited
  line height, `block` is a panel, `circle` is an avatar. Width and height come
  from Tailwind utilities, so a paragraph or a list row is several Skeletons in a
  grid. The root is `aria-hidden` and carries `data-slot='skeleton'`.

  Core adds the `--duration-ambient` (1800ms) and `--duration-sweep` (2400ms)
  tokens, the `--sheen-shade` and `--sheen-highlight` colours, the
  `animate-pulse-subtle` utility, and `animate-shimmer`, which crosses a surface
  with a highlight over that pulse. The highlight is anchored to the viewport, so
  every element wearing the class shares one sweep whatever its size, and it is
  the lighter of the two tones in both themes. Under `prefers-reduced-motion` the
  highlight is dropped and the pulse resolves to a static tint.

### Patch Changes

- f3990bd: `roadie.compiled.css` now ships `motion-scale`, `motion-slide`, `animate-shake`, `animate-nudge` and `animate-pop`, which the precompiled sheet had been dropping.
- 4deb856: - Named `duration-*` utilities set `--tw-duration`, so a variant-scoped `transition-[…]` keeps their duration, and they now ship in `roadie.compiled.css`.
  - `cn` merges `emphasis-field` with the other emphasis presets.

## 2.7.0

### Minor Changes

- 8c8b666: Refine the shadow scale so raised, floating and sunken surfaces read as
  detailed rather than heavy, and give text fields a cleaner edge.

  Each `shadow-*` level is now a hairline ring for the edge plus a stack of
  layers whose offset and blur double; higher levels add a layer and lower each
  layer's opacity instead of darkening. Light-mode shadows are a shade of the
  intent hue rather than near-black. Inset shadows drop their ring and their
  heavy dark-mode black, and gain a faint lower lip in dark mode so they still
  read as recessed.

  The `shadow-*` and `inset-shadow-*` utilities now follow dark mode and intent
  tinting. Tailwind had been compiling their light values in, so they ignored
  both — only the emphasis presets did. Token and utility names are unchanged.

  New `emphasis-field` preset for text fields: a sunken fill, one translucent
  border that takes the fill's tint, and a single inset line. It is plain CSS, so
  server-rendered markup gets the same look with
  `class="emphasis-field is-interactive-field"`. `Input`, `Textarea`, and the
  `Combobox` and `Autocomplete` input groups use it in place of
  `emphasis-sunken border border-subtle`.

  `is-interactive-field` and `is-interactive-field-group` hover now steps to
  `neutral-3` in light mode — it previously matched the resting fill — and focus
  uses `accent-1` in dark mode so a focused field stays close to its resting
  depth.

  The `Select` trigger drops its solid `border-normal`: the raised shadow's
  hairline now draws its edge, and a solid border beside it read as a double
  outline. Its open state uses the same fill as a focused field.
  While a field state colours its border, `is-interactive-field` switches off
  the raised rim light, which otherwise showed as a white gap inside the border.

## 2.6.0

### Minor Changes

- c989b7e: Add a date and time standard: a formatting module and four components.

  `@oztix/roadie-core/datetime` is a new subpath export. It turns an instant into
  text and is the single place dates are spelled. Every call takes an explicit
  `timeZone`, with no browser fallback, because an event time rendered in the
  reader's zone is silently wrong for anyone not standing at the venue.

  `dateStyle` and `timeStyle` are two names for one ladder, `full` / `long` /
  `medium` / `short` / `iso` and `long` / `medium` / `short` / `numeric`, with
  presets for each step. Ranges join with the word `to` rather than a dash, which
  screen readers skip. The meridiem closes up against the digits, so times read
  `7:30pm`.

  Alongside the presets: ranges, durations, countdowns, relative time, and
  machine readable output. `formatMachine` carries the zone's offset so a value
  identifies an instant; `formatIso` deliberately omits it, for export columns
  read as local wall-clock. Instants may be a `Date` or anything carrying
  `epochMilliseconds`, and durations may be milliseconds, an ISO 8601 string, or
  the field object `Temporal.Duration` exposes, so Temporal values work today.

  `DateTime`, `Duration` and `Countdown` are new components. They render a `time`
  element and set its machine readable value, which is the part that is easy to
  get wrong and wrong silently. `CalendarTile` is the exception: it abbreviates
  too hard to be an accessible name, so by default it is an `aria-hidden` `div`
  and the date line beside it owns the `time`. Pass `dateTime` and it becomes one
  itself, which is only right where the tile is the sole date in its region. `Countdown` animates its digits
  with `@number-flow/react`, which components now depends on directly rather than
  asking consumers to install: the root barrel imports it, and a bundler resolves
  every import before it tree shakes, so a peer would break `import { Button }`
  for anyone who had not added it. `CalendarTile` ships a matching `calendar-tile`
  CSS utility for templates that cannot run React.

  **Four visible changes to the shipped cart widget.** Day headers no longer mix
  an abbreviated weekday with a full month, so `Fri, 27 November 2026` becomes
  `Fri 27 Nov 2026`. Time and date ranges join with the word `to` rather than an
  en dash. Seat runs join with a hyphen rather than an en dash, matching how
  number ranges are already written elsewhere, so `A1–4` becomes `A1-4`. And a
  time whose timezone cannot be resolved now renders nothing rather than falling
  back to the browser's own clock, because a plausible time in the wrong zone is
  worse than no time at all.

  Rebuilds the Intermission faces so `tnum` reaches every digit. The digits 1, 4,
  6 and 9 were left proportional, so any column of numbers drifted as values
  changed. The faces are served from new CDN URLs.

## 2.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 5d05bd1: - **New `Image` component** (`@oztix/roadie-components`) — a size-aware `<img>`
  wrapper. Pass `width` and it requests a right-sized WebP from the Oztix CDN's
  ImageSharp.Web proxy plus a 1x/2x `srcSet`, cutting download bytes and
  decoded-bitmap memory (the Safari-mobile crash class). Non-Oztix URLs, and
  calls without a `width`, pass through as a plain `<img>`. `alt` is required.
  Supports `widths`, `sizes` (when set, builds a responsive small→2x `srcSet`
  ladder so smaller screens download smaller files — fixed-size images without
  `sizes` get 1x/2x), `height` (layout reservation + `aspect-ratio`, and sent to
  the proxy to crop to a fixed box — scaled across the `srcSet`), `priority`
  (eager + `fetchpriority="high"`), `format`, `quality`, `autotrim` (crop
  transparent padding server-side), a `params` escape hatch for any other
  ImageSharp.Web command (`rmode`, `ranchor`, `bgcolor`, …), `placeholder='blur'`
  (blur-up LQIP that fades in on load, auto-derived from the proxy with a
  `blurDataURL` override), `sources` (art direction — a `<picture>` with a
  different URL/crop per breakpoint), and `defer` (IntersectionObserver loading
  for off-screen carousel slides). Every image shows a subtle `bg-subtle` tint as a
  placeholder until it loads, then drops it (override with a semantic background
  utility).
  - **New `@oztix/roadie-core/image` entry point** — pure URL helpers
    `isOztixImageUrl`, `oztixImageAtWidth`, `oztixSrcSet`, and `oztixWidthLadder`
    (the responsive ladder the component uses), plus `OZTIX_IMAGE_HOSTS` /
    `OZTIX_DEVICE_WIDTHS`. For consumers building custom compositions (Vue,
    server-rendered `srcSet`) without the React component.
  - **`Card.Image` is now size-aware** — its inner `<img>` is an `<Image>`, so it
    inherits the full `Image` API (`width`/`height`/`widths`/`sizes`/`quality`/
    `autotrim`/`params`/`placeholder`/`sources`/`priority`/`defer`, the responsive
    ladder, and the `bg-subtle` placeholder).
    - **Behavior change:** card images now default to `loading='lazy'` (and
      `decoding='async'`), where the old bare `<img>` eager-loaded. Mark any
      above-the-fold card image `priority` to restore eager loading and protect
      LCP.
    - **Type narrowing:** `Card.Image` now requires `src` and `alt`, and
      `width`/`height` are `number`-only (previously `string | number` via
      `ImgHTMLAttributes`). Numeric call sites with alt text are unaffected.
  - **`render` on `Mark`, `Prose`, and `Carousel.Title`** — these still exposed the
    legacy polymorphic `as` prop. They now accept the standard Roadie `render`
    escape hatch (e.g. `<Mark render={<h2 />}>`, `<Prose render={<article />}>`,
    `<Carousel.Title render={<h3 />}>`), matching `Card`, `Breadcrumb.Link`, and
    `Carousel.TitleLink`. `as` is now `@deprecated` and will be removed in v3.0.0;
    it keeps working until then.
  - **`Breadcrumb` truncates instead of wrapping** — items no longer wrap. When the
    row runs out of room each item truncates with an ellipsis (`min-w-0` +
    `truncate` on the link/current text), while separators stay put (`shrink-0`).

## 2.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 5e3b922: `emphasis-overlay` now adapts to the active intent. Its scrim is built from the
  intent hue (`oklch(0.1 0.04 var(--intent-hue) / 0.55)`) instead of a fixed
  `rgba(0,0,0,0.5)`, so `intent-danger emphasis-overlay` reads as a dark red glass,
  `intent-accent` as a dark accent glass, etc. — while `neutral` stays a near-black
  scrim. The lightness is fixed so it remains a proper scrim in both light and dark
  themes (the intent scale flips between them).

## 2.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 82ae89b: Add generalized motion utilities to `motion.css`: `animate-nudge` and
  `animate-pop` (one-shot attention cues) plus `motion-pop-in` (fade + slide-up +
  scale entrance, pair with `origin-*`). Token-driven for duration/easing and
  covered by the global `prefers-reduced-motion` reset. These replace the
  cart-drawer widget's bespoke keyframes.
- 0ba959a: Add a `z-alert` layering tier and let `Dialog` pick its z-index from the ARIA `role`.
  - **core**: new `--z-index-alert` (80) tier above `tooltip`, for blocking alert dialogs that must stack over an open modal or drawer.
  - **components**: `Dialog.Root` accepts `role='dialog' | 'alertdialog'` (default `dialog`). `alertdialog` sets `role="alertdialog"` on the surface and raises the backdrop + surface to `z-alert`.
  - **widgets**: cart-drawer expiry modal uses `role='alertdialog'`; cart-drawer layering migrated to named z-index tiers and footer shadow tinted via `--intent-hue`.

## 2.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 2a43e97: Add Dialog, Popover, and IconTile components.
  - **Dialog** / **Popover** — `@base-ui/react` compounds with `*.Content` shortcuts, `Header`/`Body`/`Footer`, and an `intent` variant on the popup. Dialog adds `sm`/`md`/`lg` sizes; Popover adds `Arrow`, `positionerProps` placement, and `openOnHover`.
  - **IconTile** — a tile that frames a single Phosphor icon, with `xs`–`3xl` sizes, `intent`/`emphasis` variants, and `square` (default) / `circle` shapes.
  - **core**: new `layering.css` z-index scale emitting named utilities (`z-overlay`, `z-modal`, `z-popover`, …), reusable `motion-scale` / `motion-slide` enter/exit utilities in `motion.css`, and a `--rim-light-edge` token in `elevation.css`.

## 2.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 225ce2c: **Sync sRGB→OKLCH converter + unified bootstrap script + extended radius scale**

  **New sync colour utilities in `@oztix/roadie-core/colors`:**
  - `hexToOklch(hex)` — convert a hex string to `{ l, c, h }` using
    Björn Ottosson's reference sRGB→Oklab→OKLCH pipeline. Zero
    dependencies (the existing async helpers still use `colorjs.io`).
  - `getOklchHueSync(hex)` / `getOklchChromaSync(hex)` — synchronous
    siblings of the existing async helpers. Match the async output to
    four decimal places across a 20-hex representative palette.
  - `Oklch` type export.

  These unblock pre-hydration accent bootstrap: the hot path that the
  `ThemeProvider` accent effect uses (setting just `--accent-hue` and
  `--accent-chroma`) no longer needs an async `colorjs.io` import, so
  consumers can inject the accent style tag before the first paint.
  The existing async `generateAccentScale` / `generateNeutralScale`
  pipeline is unchanged — those still use `colorjs.io` for the full
  14-step hex fallback output.

  **New `getBootstrapScript` helper in `@oztix/roadie-core/theme`:**

  ```ts
  import { getBootstrapScript } from '@oztix/roadie-core/theme'

  const html = getBootstrapScript({
    followSystem: true,
    accentColor: collection?.themeColour // optional
  })
  ```

  Returns a single HTML string combining the theme script (dark-mode
  flash prevention) and an optional accent style tag. Framework-agnostic
  — drop it into `<head>` via `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, Astro's
  `set:html`, or a plain HTML template. When `accentColor` is omitted
  or `null`, only the theme script is emitted. Invalid hex input throws
  synchronously with a clear error message.

  **Extended radius scale:**

  Tailwind v4's default radius scale stops at `rounded-4xl` (2rem), so
  `rounded-5xl` and beyond silently resolved to `0px`. Roadie now adds
  three extended tiers via `@theme inline` in `tokens.css`:
  - `--radius-5xl: 2.5rem` (40px) — hero cards, collection headers
  - `--radius-6xl: 3rem` (48px) — feature banners
  - `--radius-7xl: 3.5rem` (56px) — edge-to-edge promotional layouts

  See the [shape foundation](/foundations/shape) page for usage
  guidance and the new `foundations/theming` page for the full
  dynamic-theming walkthrough.

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- 4f929b8: Migrate build pipeline from tsup to tsdown (Rolldown). Internal build-tool
  change with no consumer-facing API differences — dist shape, exports map,
  and type declarations are unchanged.
  - Rolldown preserves `"use client"` directives on entries natively, so the
    post-build hook that previously re-inserted them is gone.
  - `build:css` now invokes the `tailwindcss` bin directly instead of
    `npx @tailwindcss/cli`, eliminating stray npm warnings during builds.
  - Adds `RefAttributes` to `RadioGroup.Root` and `RadioGroup.Item` prop
    types so they match the Select/Combobox/Autocomplete convention.
  - Adds `docs/contributing/BASE_UI.md` as the canonical authoring guide
    for new Base UI wrappers.
