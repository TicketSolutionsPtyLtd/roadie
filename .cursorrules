# Roadie Design System

## Repository Structure

This is a monorepo using pnpm workspaces and Turborepo with the following structure:

- `/packages/core/` - Design tokens, themes, and utilities
- `/packages/components/` - React component library
- `/docs/` - Documentation site built with Next.js

## Tech Stack

- Package Manager: pnpm@9.15.0 (use `corepack enable` to ensure correct version)
- Build System: Turborepo
- Framework: React v19.0.0
- Component Primitives: @ark-ui/react (for complex components requiring accessibility)
- Styling: PandaCSS v1.4.3
- Language: TypeScript v5.7
- Documentation: Next.js v15 with MDX

## Key Dependencies

- React v19.0.0
- Next.js v15
- PandaCSS v1.4.3
- @ark-ui/react v5.26.2 (for complex accessible components)
- TypeScript v5.7

## External Documentation

- PandaCSS: https://panda-css.com/llms-full.txt (comprehensive API and usage docs)
- Ark UI: https://ark-ui.com/llms-react.txt (React-specific component docs)

## Recommended MCP Servers

To enable AI-assisted component building with Ark UI, install the Ark UI MCP server:
```bash
npx -y @ark-ui/mcp
```
This provides tools for listing components, getting examples, and styling guidelines.

## Code Organization Rules

1. Components must be created in `packages/components/src/`
2. Component structure:
   ```
   ComponentName/
   ├── index.tsx       # Component implementation
   └── Component.test.tsx
   ```
3. Design tokens are managed in `packages/core/src/tokens/`

## Development Standards

1. TypeScript is required for all new code
2. Use PandaCSS for styling (no CSS-in-JS)
3. Follow semantic HTML principles
4. Maintain mobile-first responsive design
5. Components must be fully accessible (ARIA)

## Linting and Formatting

- ESLint with TypeScript support
- Prettier with specific rules:
  - Single quotes
  - No semicolons
  - 2 space indentation
  - 80 character line limit
  - Sorted imports using @trivago/prettier-plugin-sort-imports

## Styling

- Use PandaCSS for styling (no CSS-in-JS)
- Use semantic tokens for styling (no hardcoded colors)
- Use `_hover` and `_active` pseudo-classes for hover and active states
- Don't append `.default` to color tokens, it's redundant.
- Use `View` as the root component for most components.
- Prefer gap over margin for spacing

## Component creation guidelines

- Simple components should use native HTML elements (button, div, etc.)
- Complex components requiring accessibility should use @ark-ui/react primitives
- Use `View` as the root component for most components
- Prefer gap over margin for spacing
- Prefer `Text` over `span` for text content
- Prefer `Heading` over `h1`-`h6` for headings
- Use standard HTML props (e.g., `onClick`, `disabled`) instead of framework-specific props
- Document all props and variants in the component file for use with the docs site

## Content writing guidelines

- Use sentence case for headings, titles, and other content
- Keep documentation concise and focused on one topic per section
- Use active voice and present tense
- Include practical code examples for each concept
- Structure content with clear headings and subheadings
- Use lists and tables to organize information
- Explain technical terms when first introduced
- Include "dos and don'ts" where applicable
- Link to related documentation when referencing other topics
- Keep code examples simple and focused on the concept being explained
- Use consistent terminology throughout documentation
- Include troubleshooting sections for complex features
- Write in a friendly, conversational tone
- Highlight important information using callouts or blockquotes
- Keep paragraphs short and scannable (3-4 sentences max)

## Type Checking

- Strict TypeScript mode enabled
- No explicit any
- No unused variables/parameters
- Consistent casing in filenames
- Force module resolution through bundler

## Testing Requirements

- Vitest for unit testing (Jest-compatible)
- React Testing Library for component tests
- Test files must be co-located with components
- Coverage requirements enforced

## Build Configuration

- ESM modules only
- Source maps enabled
- Clean builds enforced
- External dependencies properly marked
- Bundling through tsup

## Documentation Rules

- All components must have MDX documentation
- Props and variants must be documented
- Accessibility considerations required
- Usage examples mandatory

## Workspace Dependencies

- Core package: @oztix/roadie-core
- Component package: @oztix/roadie-components
- Documentation: Next.js with MDX support

## Git Rules

- Feature branches: feature/[ticket-number]-description
- Clean commit messages
- PR requirements:
  - Link to ticket
  - Screenshots for visual changes
  - Dev and design approvals

## Release Management

- Changesets are used to manage versioning and releases
- Each PR that includes user-facing changes must include a changeset
- Changesets should be created using `pnpm changeset`
- Types of changes:
  - major: Breaking changes
  - minor: New features
  - patch: Bug fixes and minor updates
- Release process:
  1. Create changeset(s) for your changes
  2. Get PR approved and merged
  3. Maintainers will periodically create releases from accumulated changesets
